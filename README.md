### Installing NestJs:
To install NestJs, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal (It is recommended to use GitBash or your IDE's terminal).
2. Execute the following command to install NestJs on your device:

```bash
  npm i -g @nestjs/cli
```

### Repository Installation:
To clone the repository to your local machine and access the project's files, use the following command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Arangog20/back-onhealth.git
```

This ensures that the repository is available on your device for you to use its information and work on it.

#### Dependencies used:
- `@nestjs/mapped-types`: Facilitates the creation of mapped types in NestJS.
- `class-validator`: Adds validations to TypeScript classes.
- `class-transformer`: Allows safe and efficient object transformation.
- `@nestjs/config`: Configuration module for NestJS.
- `@nestjs/typeorm` & `typeorm`: Packages for interacting with PostgreSQL databases.

#### Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

### Running the project
To run the project, open your console and execute the following command to initialize the project:

```bash
  npm run start:dev
```

### Environment variables
We need to assign values to the environment variables for optimal project execution. In this case, the project's environment variables cover the connection to our database with PostgreSQL.

```bash
  # .env - CONNECTION in Vercel - TypeORM.
  DB_USERNAME = 'YOU DB USERNAME'
  DB_HOST = 'YOUR DB HOST'
  DB_PASSWORD = 'YOUR DB PASSWORD'
  DB_NAME = 'YOUR DB NAME'

  DB_PORT = 'YOUR PORT'
```

### Postman
You can execute each of the services already established in the project through the endpoints that have been set up in a Postman collection, from creating, editing, deleting, and other actions.

Access the Postman collection:
- [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/red-flare-845361/workspace/public-manuela/collection/33481513-b94850ba-5b3d-4c2a-8ce0-4450ba3e2eb3?action=share&creator=33481513&active-environment=33481513-7dda199c-ec6e-4860-84f4-bec46dd60cb4)
